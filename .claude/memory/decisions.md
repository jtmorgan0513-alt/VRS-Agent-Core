### ADR-010: AES-256-GCM + scrypt(SESSION_SECRET, perRowSalt) for agent credential storage
**Date**: 2026-04-26
**Status**: Active
**Context**: TD3b in the calculator + intake form plan required at-rest encryption for per-agent calculator credentials. We need to decrypt on every iframe load so an envelope/KMS round-trip per request is too expensive, and we don't want to add a new managed-secret dependency.
**Decision**: Use Node's built-in `crypto` AES-256-GCM. Derive a per-row encryption key via `scrypt(SESSION_SECRET, perRowSalt, 32)` — `SESSION_SECRET` is already managed in Replit Secrets, already required for JWT signing, and rotating it already invalidates all sessions, so binding credential decryption to the same secret has no new operational cost. Per-row 16-byte salt prevents key reuse across rows. Store base64(ciphertext), base64(iv), base64(authTag), base64(salt) in `agent_external_credentials`. Pack BOTH per-field GCM auth tags into a single 32-byte base64 column (with xor'd IVs across the two ciphertexts) so the schema only needs one auth_tag column instead of two.
**Consequences**:
- (+) Zero new infra. Server never logs cleartext.
- (+) Rotating SESSION_SECRET invalidates stored credentials AND sessions atomically — agents are re-prompted to log in AND to re-save calculator credentials. Acceptable given the rarity of secret rotation.
- (−) No HSM-grade isolation. A server-side process compromise would let the attacker decrypt all stored credentials — this is documented and accepted in the threat model since the alternative is to not store calculator credentials at all and force agents to type them every time.
- (−) The xor'd IV trick needs a brief comment in `crypto.ts` so future maintainers don't think the IV is being reused naively.

**Browser-side handling (added 2026-04-26 after architect review):** the iframe `src` is the calculator base URL ONLY — credentials are never appended as query params (would leak to history + remote access logs). The `postMessage` envelope's `targetOrigin` is pinned to the parsed calculator origin (never `"*"`), so a navigated/compromised iframe will not receive credentials. Final fallback is the agent manually copying via the iframe header's Copy buttons (clipboard write).

### ADR-012: Stage 3 Smartsheet Intake reordered to AFTER Authorize & Send
**Date**: 2026-04-26
**Status**: Active (amends ADR-011's gate predicate; ADR-011 itself remains the architecture for atomic claim + 24h release window)
**Context**: Tyler reviewed the original ordering (intake collected DURING Stage 1/Stage 2 review, before Authorize & Send) and asked us to make Smartsheet the LAST step, gated behind a successful Authorize & Send. The original ordering had three real problems: (1) it asked agents to type Smartsheet payload while still deciding whether the ticket should even be approved — many fields differ depending on the decision; (2) rejected/invalid tickets were unnecessarily blocking the next claim because they were caught by the gate predicate `ticket_status IN ('completed','rejected','invalid','approved')` even though they have no Smartsheet row to file; (3) agents could complete the intake before authorize and then never authorize, leaving an `intake_forms` row referencing a not-yet-authorized submission.
**Decision**: Make the resolution panel a 3-stage progressive disclosure. Stage 3 (Smartsheet Intake) replaces Stage 2 in the same panel slot the moment `ticketStatus` flips to `"approved"` AND `auth_code` is non-null AND `request_type != 'parts_nla'` AND no `intake_forms` row exists. Server is the single source of truth via `GET /api/submissions/:id/intake-form-status`. Tighten `getMissingIntakeForAgent`'s WHERE clause to match (`ticket_status = 'approved' AND auth_code IS NOT NULL`) so the sidebar badge, claim-gate, and Stage 3 visibility all read the same predicate. Add a required attestation checkbox to the intake review modal so the audit row is only created when the agent attests they actually saw Smartsheet's success page. Keep the post-Authorize redirect inside the same ticket: scroll Stage 3 into view rather than clearing selection. NO schema changes — every signal already existed.
**Consequences**:
- (+) Workflow now matches the natural decision sequence: review → decide → authorize → log. Zero context-switching mid-decision.
- (+) Rejected / invalid tickets stop blocking the agent's next claim — they never needed a Smartsheet row.
- (+) The audit row in `intake_forms` is now harder to fabricate — the modal's required checkbox forces a deliberate attestation.
- (+) Server-side single source of truth eliminates the class of bug where client-side gating logic drifts from server-side gating.
- (−) Adds one more network round-trip per opened ticket (the `/intake-form-status` query). Acceptable: it's a single tiny GET, cached by TanStack Query, invalidated on the same events that already invalidate the `/api/submissions` predicate.
- (−) The required attestation checkbox is honor-system — Smartsheet's hosted form is cross-origin, we can't programmatically detect their success page from inside the iframe. Accepted as the cheapest correct option until/unless Todd Pennington enables Smartsheet's redirect-URL feature (already deferred to Phase 2).
- (−) An agent who navigates away mid-flow may not realize Stage 3 is waiting; the sidebar "Pending Smartsheet Intake (N)" badge is the visual forcing function before the gate kicks in.

**Race-condition fix (added after architect review, 2026-04-26):** `selectedSubmission.ticketStatus` and `intakeFormStatusQuery.data` come from two separate queries. During the invalidation window after Authorize, the per-submission intake-form-status endpoint may already report `required=true` (because the server-side update has landed) while the cached `selectedSubmission` still reports `ticketStatus='pending'`. Without an additional client-side guard, this caused Stage 1/2 and Stage 3 to render simultaneously for a few hundred ms. Mitigation: the Stage 1/2 card render predicate now also requires `!stage3Required && !stage3Recorded`, making Stage 3 a true replacement rather than an addition. NLA Stage 1/2 is unaffected (NLA tickets never trigger Stage 3).

**Note on per-submission vs. per-agent gating predicates:** the per-submission `/intake-form-status` endpoint and the per-agent `getMissingIntakeForAgent`/sidebar query intentionally use slightly different predicates. The per-submission endpoint asks "is THIS ticket missing an intake row?" and answers yes for any approved+authorized non-NLA ticket without an `intake_forms` row, regardless of who reviewed it or when. The per-agent query asks "does the current agent have unfinished intake work in their last 24h?" and is scoped to `reviewed_by = agent` + 24h window. They're aligned on the core release signal (`intake_forms` row exists) but the per-submission view is broader so that opening any historical missing-intake ticket surfaces Stage 3 immediately. This is by design and the architect's note about predicate "drift" was reframed accordingly — they're complementary, not redundant.

### ADR-011: Atomic UPDATE-WHERE claim + 24h intake-form gate (vrs_agent only)
**Date**: 2026-04-26
**Status**: Active
**Context**: T5 in the calculator + intake form plan required two protections on `PATCH /api/submissions/:id/claim`: (1) prevent two agents from racing to claim the same row; (2) prevent agents from racking up unfinished intake forms by gating new claims on completing the Smartsheet intake form for any recently-reviewed non-NLA ticket.
**Decision**: Replace the read-then-update sequence with `storage.claimSubmission(id, agentId)` which executes `UPDATE submissions SET ... WHERE id = $1 AND ticket_status = 'queued' RETURNING *` — atomic at the DB level, no advisory locks needed. Add `storage.getMissingIntakeForAgent(agentId)` which scans for submissions reviewed by this agent in the last 24h with `ticket_status != 'queued'`, `request_type != 'parts_nla'`, and no matching `intake_forms` row. Apply the gate ONLY for `vrs_agent` role; admins/super_admins bypass (they're often picking up someone else's queue or covering escalations and asking them to fill an unrelated intake form would be wrong). On 409, frontend auto-routes to the blocking submission and pops the intake review modal.
**Consequences**:
- (+) Race-free claim with zero coordination overhead.
- (+) Gate is psychologically and operationally aligned: agents finish what they started before grabbing the next one.
- (+) Clean 409 contract with structured codes (`INTAKE_REQUIRED`, `ALREADY_CLAIMED`) and `blockingSubmissionId`.
- (−) Gate state is computed on every claim attempt — O(N) over recent reviews. Negligible at current volume; if it becomes hot we'd add a `pending_intake_count` denormalized counter on `users`.
- (−) The existing claim-route code path was rewritten — care taken to keep auth checks identical and to handle the case where the row was already claimed between auth checks and atomic UPDATE (returns 409 ALREADY_CLAIMED rather than 200).

### ADR-001: Part Numbers Storage Format
**Date**: 2026-04-16
**Status**: Active
**Context**: NLA submissions needed to distinguish between parts that are unavailable (NLA) and parts that are available but must stay on the order.
**Decision**: Store as JSON object `{"nla": [...], "available": [...]}` in the existing `partNumbers` text column. Backward compatible — old array format `["PART1", "PART2"]` still parses and displays correctly.
**Consequences**: All display code (agent dashboard, tech detail, XLSX export) must handle both formats.

### ADR-002: Upload Diagnostics as Server Logs Only
**Date**: 2026-04-16
**Status**: Active
**Context**: iPhone photo uploads were failing with zero server-side visibility. Needed diagnostics without adding database complexity.
**Decision**: Fire-and-forget `POST /api/uploads/report-error` endpoint that logs `console.error("[UPLOAD-DIAGNOSTIC]", ...)`. No database table, no retention policy.
**Consequences**: Diagnostics only visible in deployment logs. Sufficient for debugging since upload failures are infrequent.

### ADR-003: Admin Notification Without Status Toggle
**Date**: 2026-04-16
**Status**: Active
**Context**: Admins had no online/offline toggle, so their `agentStatus` defaulted to "offline" and they were excluded from all WebSocket broadcasts.
**Decision**: Broadcast functions check role separately — admins/super_admins skip status check entirely and always receive notifications when connected via WebSocket.
**Consequences**: Admins cannot opt out of notifications while on the dashboard. Acceptable since they are supervisory.

### ADR-004: Schema and Data Safety Guardrails
**Date**: 2026-04-16
**Status**: Active
**Context**: Two AI agents (Replit Agent + Claude AI) both modify code. Schema changes via Drizzle `db:push` can silently drop columns/data. Seed.ts runs on every restart with potentially destructive operations.
**Decision**: Multi-layer protection: (1) `drizzle.config.ts` uses `strict: true` + `verbose: true` to force confirmation on destructive changes. (2) `shared/schema.ts` has a safety header with explicit rules. (3) `cleanupTestSubmissions()` gated behind `NODE_ENV !== "production"`. (4) `deleteUser()` in storage refuses system accounts and logs cascading deletes. (5) Delete user API blocks self-delete and super_admin deletion.
**Consequences**: Schema changes require explicit confirmation. Test cleanup won't run in production. Accidental user deletion is harder. Both AI agents have documented rules in their respective instruction files.
