# Changelog

All notable changes to the VRS Digital Authorization Platform will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Deployment Notes
- This release adds a new `submission_notes` table. Before deploying, run `npm run db:push` in the Replit environment (production-bound `DATABASE_URL`) or the `POST|GET /api/submissions/:id/notes` endpoints will 500 on first write.
- This release **also adds two more tables**: `intake_forms` (Smartsheet "VRS Unrep Intake Form 2.0" submission audit) and `agent_external_credentials` (encrypted per-agent calculator credentials). Run `npm run db:push` once before deploy or the new endpoints (`POST /api/submissions/:id/intake-form/{preview,confirm}`, `GET /api/submissions/:id/intake-form-status`, `GET|POST|DELETE /api/agent/credentials/calculator`, `POST .../reveal`, `GET /api/agent/intake-status`) and the new claim-gate (`PATCH /api/submissions/:id/claim`) will 500 on first call. The new claim-gate query (`getMissingIntakeForAgent`) only runs for `vrs_agent` role users — admins bypass it — so super_admin / admin sessions will continue to work even before db:push, but agents will see "Failed to claim" until the migration is applied.
- **The Stage 3 reordering follow-up (2026-04-26) requires NO additional schema changes** — it reuses the existing `intake_forms`, `submissions.ticket_status`, `submissions.auth_code`, and `submissions.request_type` columns. The single new endpoint (`GET /api/submissions/:id/intake-form-status`) does not touch any new tables.

### Changed — Stage 3 Smartsheet Intake reordering (2026-04-26)
- **Smartsheet intake is now the LAST step in the agent flow, gated behind a successful Authorize & Send.** Previously the intake fieldset appeared on the resolution panel during Stage 1 / Stage 2 (`ticketStatus === "pending"`); it now appears in a new **Stage 3** card that replaces Stage 2 in the resolution-panel slot the moment the ticket flips to `ticketStatus === "approved"` with `auth_code` populated. The 3-segment progress bar makes the journey visible from the start (Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3), and Stage 3 collapses into a "Smartsheet Intake Recorded" success card after the agent confirms.
- **New endpoint**: `GET /api/submissions/:id/intake-form-status` — single source of truth for Stage 3 visibility. Returns `{ required, recorded, reason?, intakeForm? }`. The agent dashboard never re-derives the gate locally; client UI and server-side claim gate read from the same predicate.
- **Tightened claim-gate predicate** in `storage.getMissingIntakeForAgent`: previously fired for any reviewed-but-not-recorded non-NLA submission in the last 24h (`ticket_status IN ('completed','rejected','invalid','approved')`); now narrows to `ticket_status = 'approved' AND auth_code IS NOT NULL`. **Net effect**: rejected / invalid tickets no longer block the agent's next claim — they never needed a Smartsheet row in the first place. The claim-gate still uses an `intake_forms` row as the release signal, so the 24h window from T5 is preserved unchanged.
- **Required attestation checkbox** in the intake review modal: the "I submitted Smartsheet" button is now disabled until the agent ticks "I confirmed the Smartsheet success page appeared after clicking Submit inside the form above." Guards against the audit row in `intake_forms` being recorded when the agent never clicked Smartsheet's own Submit button inside the iframe.
- **Pending Smartsheet Intake (N) sidebar badge** on the agent dashboard. Click-through routes to the most-recent blocking submission and auto-switches to My Tickets so Stage 3 renders without further interaction. The badge is driven by the same `/api/agent/intake-status` endpoint the claim-gate uses, so the badge can never disagree with a 409 INTAKE_REQUIRED.
- **Post-Authorize redirect**: `processMutation.onSuccess` now keeps the just-authorized ticket selected when Stage 3 is required (non-NLA `approve` actions), and scrolls Stage 3 into view after the cache flips. Stage 1 mid-flow (`approve_submission` on 2-stage warranties) keeps the ticket selected as before. Reject / invalid / reject_and_close still clear the selection.
- **Tech-side impact: zero.** Smartsheet intake is internal to VRS — no SMS, no field on the tech's submission view, no notification. Tech experience after Authorize & Send is identical.
- **Files**: `server/storage.ts`, `server/routes.ts`, `client/src/pages/agent-dashboard.tsx`, `client/src/components/intake-form-review-modal.tsx`. Smoke test (`tsx scripts/test-intake-url.ts`) still passes — URL builder behavior unchanged.

### Added — Calculator + Smartsheet Intake Form (2026-04-26)
- **Tabbed right-panel** on the agent dashboard: the existing "Service Order History" panel is now the left tab of a `Tabs` control whose right tab embeds the Repair/Replace Calculator (`https://repairreplacecalculator.replit.app/`) as a sandboxed iframe. Tab choice is persisted per-agent in `localStorage` under `agent:${user.id}:rightPanel`. Existing show/hide test IDs (`button-show-shsai`, `button-hide-shsai`) and the SHSAI refresh button are preserved.
- **Per-agent encrypted calculator credentials**: agents can save their calculator username + password once (gear icon inside the Calculator tab) and the iframe will auto-fill on load via `postMessage` (clipboard-copy fallback in the iframe header for the current Streamlit form, which doesn't yet listen for the envelope). Cleartext is encrypted server-side with AES-256-GCM, key derived from `SESSION_SECRET` via scrypt with a per-row salt; the server never logs cleartext and the `/reveal` endpoint is the only path that ever returns the password (over HTTPS, only to the owning agent's session). The browser-side `postMessage` call pins `targetOrigin` to the calculator origin (never `"*"`), and credentials are NEVER appended as iframe URL query params (avoiding leaks to browser history and remote access logs). New file: `server/services/crypto.ts`. New table: `agent_external_credentials` (unique on user_id+service).
- **Smartsheet intake form fieldset** on the resolution panel: branch-aware (AHS / Sears Protect Heating-Cooling / Sears Protect Whole Home / Sears Repair Warranty / Insurance Service Plan), surfacing only the fields the chosen branch actually requires. Hard-block validation gates the "Submit Intake to Smartsheet" button until required fields are filled. Detected from the ticket's `procId` against the field map in `docs/intake_form_field_map.md`. New files: `client/src/lib/intake-form-config.ts`, `client/src/components/intake-form-fieldset.tsx`.
- **Intake form review modal**: clicking "Submit Intake to Smartsheet" opens a modal that previews the agent's payload, embeds the pre-filled Smartsheet form as an iframe (live URL built server-side via `server/services/smartsheet.ts` with a column-label allow-list), and on confirm records the row in `intake_forms`. New file: `client/src/components/intake-form-review-modal.tsx`. New endpoints: `POST /api/submissions/:id/intake-form/preview` and `.../confirm`.
- **Server-side claim gate**: `PATCH /api/submissions/:id/claim` now (1) checks `getMissingIntakeForAgent` and returns `409 INTAKE_REQUIRED { blockingSubmissionId, blockingServiceOrder }` if the agent has any reviewed-but-not-recorded non-NLA submission from the last 24h; (2) replaces the read-then-update claim with an atomic `UPDATE submissions SET ... WHERE id = $1 AND ticket_status = 'queued'` so two agents racing for the same row both go through auth checks but only one wins. Frontend handles the 409 by auto-routing to the blocking submission and popping the intake review modal. New storage methods in `server/storage.ts`: `claimSubmission`, `getMissingIntakeForAgent`, `getIntakeFormBySubmission`, `createIntakeForm`, plus `getAgentCredential`, `upsertAgentCredential`, `deleteAgentCredential`.
- **Intake form smoke test + checklist**: `scripts/test-intake-url.ts` (runnable via `tsx scripts/test-intake-url.ts`) exercises `buildIntakeFormUrl` across all five branches, and `docs/intake_form_smoke_checklist.md` walks through a manual end-to-end pass post-deploy.
- **Field map doc**: `docs/intake_form_field_map.md` captures the verbatim branch / column mapping Tyler walked through, including the four branches still flagged INCOMPLETE (full Repair-Warranty + ISP question lists). `docs/intake_form_default_snapshot.yml` was extended with branch metadata.

### Added
- **Pre-submit review dialog**: Hitting Submit now opens an AlertDialog showing a summary of everything about to be sent — service order, phone, appliance, warranty, request type, description preview + length, counts for estimate photos / issue photos / video / voice note, and NLA parts lists. Amber "heads up" section flags soft issues (description under 50 chars, only one issue photo, NLA without part numbers); green "looks complete" note shows when nothing is flagged. Techs can "Go back & edit" or "Confirm & submit." Addresses field-feedback (Kenneth Hokanson, 2026-04-23) that techs forget estimate screenshots and want a double-check before confirming.
- **Post-submission notes**: New `submission_notes` table + `POST|GET /api/submissions/:id/notes` endpoints. Technicians can add follow-up notes (clarification, updated diagnosis, additional context) from the submission detail page without creating a new ticket. Notes are scoped so a technician can only post to their own submissions; agents and admins can post without that restriction. Reads are also scoped — technicians can only read notes on their own submissions. Requires `npm run db:push` before first deploy (see Deployment Notes).
- **Inline routing warning for AHS/FA NLA**: When a technician selects the NLA request type with an AHS or First American warranty, a red banner explains that VRS does not process AHS/FA NLA and points them to TechHub. Help Center also gained a "Which pathway do I use?" how-to covering the full Auth vs NLA vs TechHub decision grid, including B2B routing.
- **"Submission received" SMS with wait-time context**: Sent to the technician immediately on submission creation. AHS/FA submissions get language about provider callbacks and extended wait times; NLA submissions get turnaround language; standard Sears Protect gets short-wait language. Help Center FAQ expanded with the same breakdown.
- **Technician submission form auto-saves drafts**: The new-submission form now continuously saves a draft to the device (text fields, model/SO, part numbers, uploaded photos, video, voice note, AI-enhanced description) so techs no longer lose their work if they back out to TechHub, switch apps, refresh, or the app reloads. When they return, a "Draft restored" banner appears with a "Start fresh" button to discard. The draft is cleared automatically on successful submission. Per-user (drafts are namespaced by user ID so devices shared by multiple techs don't leak content).
- **Reject & Close suppresses cash-call line for AHS / First American and infestation cases**: SMS to the technician (and the agent-side preview) no longer says "You may offer the customer a cash call estimate" when the warranty is American Home Shield or First American, or when the reason text or agent's note mentions infestation. Updated in `server/sms.ts`, `client/src/lib/smsPreview.ts`, and the agent dashboard preview wiring.
- **Admin Ticket Overview lightbox stays open while navigating photos**: Clicking the prev/next chevrons used to close the entire ticket dialog. The lightbox is now rendered in a portal with explicit pointer-event handling and the dialog ignores outside interactions while the lightbox is open.

### Added
- **Live SMS preview pane on every agent action form**: Agents now see a live, auto-updating preview of the exact SMS the technician will receive — across all 6 action forms (Stage 1 reject, reject & close, mark invalid, Stage 1 approve / approve_submission, Stage 2 auth-code approval, and all NLA actions). The preview renders below the message textarea with character + segment count, so agents can avoid duplicating boilerplate (e.g. "Order from TechHub") that the system auto-includes. New files: `client/src/lib/smsPreview.ts` (pure preview-string builders mirroring server templates) and `client/src/components/sms-preview.tsx` (styled preview box).
- **Renamed "Message to Technician" → "Additional context (optional)"** with helper text on every action form, explaining what the tech will already see automatically vs. what the agent should add. Reduces redundant duplication of boilerplate. NLA forms keep the field as required and label it "Additional context for the technician *".

### Changed
- **Standardized "Message to Technician" branding across SMS and in-app**: Previously the same `technicianMessage` field appeared to techs under four different labels — "Agent message:", "Agent notes:", "Instructions:", and "Agent Message:" — depending on which action path was used. All channels now use a consistent, branded prefix:
  - **`Feedback from VRS — Action required:`** when the tech needs to do something (Stage 1 reject + resubmit, NLA reject + resubmit, NLA part-found-tech-orders).
  - **`Feedback from VRS:`** for informational messages (reject and close, NLA P-card confirm).
  - **No prefix** on approval paths (Stage 1 approve, final approve / auth code, NLA approval) — the agent's optional note is appended inline as an extra paragraph since "feedback" wording felt awkward on positive outcomes. If the agent leaves the note blank, the SMS is just the standard approval text with no extra section.
  - Updated in `server/sms.ts` (`buildNlaApprovalMessage`, `buildAuthCodeMessage`), six call sites in `server/routes.ts` (lines ~1233, 1328, 1347, 1555, 1611, 1630), and three rendered labels in `client/src/pages/submission-detail.tsx` (NLA tech-orders, rejected, rejected_closed). Two agent-side preview labels in `client/src/pages/agent-dashboard.tsx` (lines ~1993, 3170) were also unified to "Message to Technician:" for clarity to the agent.

### Fixed
- **Per-file upload failure visibility**: When a photo fails to upload, the file now appears in a red-bordered list under the photo grid with a Retry button, instead of only showing an aggregate toast. Techs can retry individual files without reselecting the ones that already succeeded.
- **Resubmit form silently failed for AHS / First American tickets**: The Zod schema on `client/src/pages/tech-resubmit.tsx` only allowed `warrantyType: "sears_protect"`, so form validation silently rejected rejected AHS/FA tickets on submit (no visible error — the field isn't rendered). Technicians had to create a new ticket instead. Schema now matches `tech-submit.tsx` and accepts all three providers.

### Added
- **Rejection reason shown in technician history list**: Previously techs had to tap through to each rejected ticket's detail page to see why it was rejected. The history list now shows a compact `Reason: …` line (2-line clamp, destructive color) under cards with `rejected` or `rejected_closed` status. Reads from `rejectionReasons` (JSON array) with safe fallback to `stage1RejectionReason`.

### Added
- Schema safety rules header in `shared/schema.ts` (never rename/retype/remove columns)
- `strict: true` and `verbose: true` in `drizzle.config.ts` for destructive change prompts
- Self-delete prevention on `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id`
- Super admin deletion prevention on `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id`
- System account guard in `storage.deleteUser()` (throws instead of silently proceeding)
- Cascade deletion logging in `storage.deleteUser()` — warns with count of affected submissions
- Production guard on `cleanupTestSubmissions()` — skipped when `NODE_ENV=production`
- Schema & Data Safety sections in `CLAUDE.md` and `replit.md`
